# AmongUsTerminalSim
A barebones terminal simulator of the famous game Among Us. Implements a turn based system and a Health Point system. Also supports an open strategy mode which can be accessed by uncommenting certain marked sections of the Game.java file.

Written in Java. Compile the java files and run Main.java to try the game out. 

Applied concepts of Exception Handling throughout the code, and also utilizes OOPS concepts like Generic Programming and makes use of Java Collection Framework.

Good for Java OOPS concepts practice and first issues.
